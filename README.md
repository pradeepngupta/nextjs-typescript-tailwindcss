## Overview

This repository provides a robust boilerplate for building web applications using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 
It includes configurations for ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Enzyme, and Playwright to ensure code quality and testing.

Next JS is the Powerful React Framework for building Web Applications.
Together with TypeScript, it provides a great developer experience and a scalable architecture.
And with Tailwind CSS, you can create beautiful and responsive web applications.

Integrating with ESLint and Prettier makes the code more readable.
And with Jest and Enzyme, you can write and run tests.
And Playwright for End-to-End testing.
